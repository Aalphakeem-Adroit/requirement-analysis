# Requirement Analysis in Software Development  

## Introduction  
This repository documents the **Requirement Analysis Project** for a **Booking Management System**.  
Its purpose is to simulate a real-world software development scenario by analyzing, structuring, and documenting system requirements.  

Through this project, the foundation for successful project execution is established by:  
- Defining functional and non-functional requirements.  
- Creating clear use cases and user stories.  
- Providing a detailed blueprint to guide the design, development, and testing phases.  

The repository emphasizes clarity, precision, and structure in requirement analysis, ensuring that the booking management system is well-planned before implementation.  


## What is Requirement Analysis?  

**Requirement Analysis** is the process of identifying, gathering, documenting, and validating the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system. It acts as the foundation of the **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** by ensuring that the final product aligns with business objectives and user requirements.  

During requirement analysis, project teams interact with stakeholders to:  
- Understand the **problem domain** and the **end goals** of the system.  
- Translate vague ideas into **clear, actionable requirements**.  
- Resolve conflicts between different stakeholder needs.  
- Define the **scope and boundaries** of the system to avoid misunderstandings.  

### ðŸ”‘ Importance in the SDLC  
1. **Clarity and Alignment** â€“ Ensures that developers, designers, testers, and stakeholders share the same understanding of the system.  
2. **Reduced Errors and Costs** â€“ Identifying issues early in the requirement phase prevents costly rework during development.  
3. **Structured Roadmap** â€“ Provides a blueprint that guides subsequent phases such as design, coding, testing, and deployment.  
4. **Risk Mitigation** â€“ Helps anticipate challenges and ambiguities before development begins.  
5. **Quality Assurance** â€“ Ensures that the final system satisfies both functional needs (what the system should do) and non-functional needs (performance, security, usability, etc.).  

In short, **requirement analysis is the backbone of successful software development**â€”without it, projects risk scope creep, budget overruns, and systems that fail to meet user needs.  


## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?  

Requirement Analysis is a **critical phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** because it sets the direction for the entire project. A well-executed requirement analysis ensures that the final product delivers value to both the business and its users. Below are some key reasons why it is important:  

### 1. Prevents Miscommunication and Misunderstanding  
Clear requirements help ensure that **stakeholders, developers, and testers** share the same understanding of the system. This minimizes confusion, reduces conflicting expectations, and aligns everyone toward a common goal.  

### 2. Saves Time and Reduces Costs  
Identifying issues, gaps, or ambiguities **early in the project** is far less costly than discovering them during development or testing. Proper requirement analysis prevents unnecessary rework, delays, and budget overruns.  

### 3. Provides a Strong Foundation for Design and Development  
Requirements act as a **blueprint for the system design and coding process**. Without a structured set of requirements, developers may build features that donâ€™t align with user needs, leading to wasted effort and poor system quality.  

### 4. Helps Manage Scope and Risks  
By defining the systemâ€™s **boundaries and priorities**, requirement analysis reduces the chances of **scope creep** (uncontrolled changes or growth in project scope). It also allows teams to anticipate risks and plan mitigation strategies.  

### 5. Improves Quality and User Satisfaction  
Well-defined requirements ensure that the **final system meets both functional and non-functional needs** such as performance, usability, and security. This directly contributes to user satisfaction and overall system success.  


## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis  

Requirement Analysis involves several structured activities that help ensure the system is well-defined and aligned with stakeholder expectations. Below are the five key activities:  

- **Requirement Gathering**  
  - Collecting information about what stakeholders need from the system.  
  - Involves interviews, surveys, observations, and reviewing existing documentation.  
  - Focuses on capturing all possible requirements at an initial level.  

- **Requirement Elicitation**  
  - Engaging with stakeholders to **clarify, refine, and uncover hidden needs**.  
  - Techniques include brainstorming sessions, workshops, prototyping, and use case discussions.  
  - Ensures both functional and non-functional requirements are identified.  

- **Requirement Documentation**  
  - Recording the gathered and elicited requirements in a structured, clear, and precise format.  
  - Common artifacts include **Software Requirement Specification (SRS)**, user stories, and use case diagrams.  
  - Acts as a reference point throughout the SDLC.  

- **Requirement Analysis and Modeling**  
  - Examining requirements to detect conflicts, overlaps, or ambiguities.  
  - Modeling the system using tools such as **flowcharts, data flow diagrams (DFD), and Unified Modeling Language (UML)** diagrams.  
  - Helps visualize how the system should behave and interact with users.  

- **Requirement Validation**  
  - Reviewing requirements with stakeholders to ensure they are accurate, complete, and feasible.  
  - Confirms that requirements meet business goals and user expectations.  
  - Helps identify errors early, reducing the risk of project failure.  


## Types of Requirements

### Functional Requirements  
These specify **what the system should do**â€”the specific behaviors, features, and interactions it must support. In the context of a Booking Management System (inspired by hotel booking apps like Airbnb/OYO), functional requirements include:

- **Hotel Onboarding and Management**  
  - The system shall allow hotel managers to onboard a new hotel, update metadata, and upload images for listings.

- **Search and Discovery**  
  - The system shall enable users to search for hotels by location, availability, and room type.

- **Viewing Hotel Details**  
  - The system shall display detailed hotel information including room types, availability, pricing, and images.

- **Reservation Handling**  
  - The system shall allow users to create and cancel reservations for available rooms.

- **Payment Processing**  
  - The system shall facilitate booking transactions through integration with payment services.

---

### Non-functional Requirements  
These define **how the system should be**â€”the qualities and constraints that shape its performance, reliability, and user experience. From the same domain and case study context, key non-functional requirements include:

- **Consistency (no double booking)**  
  - The system shall ensure strong consistency; once a booking is made and paid for, availability must update immediately to prevent overbooking.

- **High Scalability and Concurrency Handling**  
  - The system shall support high user concurrency, especially during peak periods, enabling many users to perform searches and bookings simultaneously.

- **Low Latency / Fast Response Time**  
  - The system shall respond quickly to search and booking requests to maintain a smooth user experience.

- **Availability and Reliability**  
  - The system shall be highly available and reliable, minimizing downtime and ensuring consistent access for users and hotel partners.

- **Security and Data Integrity**  
  - The system shall protect user data and transaction integrity, ensuring secure authentication, authorization, and payment handling.
