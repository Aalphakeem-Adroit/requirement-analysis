# Requirement Analysis in Software Development  

## Introduction  
This repository documents the **Requirement Analysis Project** for a **Booking Management System**.  
Its purpose is to simulate a real-world software development scenario by analyzing, structuring, and documenting system requirements.  

Through this project, the foundation for successful project execution is established by:  
- Defining functional and non-functional requirements.  
- Creating clear use cases and user stories.  
- Providing a detailed blueprint to guide the design, development, and testing phases.  

The repository emphasizes clarity, precision, and structure in requirement analysis, ensuring that the booking management system is well-planned before implementation.
